# Web Development Project 7 - *Crewmates*

Submitted by: **Reginald Kotey Appiah-Sekyere**

This web app: **I made a replica of the example site given to us. This app allows one to add to their crew, update crewmates and delete crew mates. I used Superbase for the storage of the data used on my site**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **A create form allows users to add new cremates**
- [X] **Users can name the crewmate and set the crewmate's attributes by clicking on one of several values**
- [X] **The site displays a summary page of all the user's added crewmates**
- [X] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the crewmate list**
- [X] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**
- [X] **Each crewmate has a direct, unique link to an info page about them**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attributes
- [X] The site displays summary statistics about a user's crew on their crew page 
- [X] The site displays a custom "success" metric about a user's crew which changes the look of the crewmate list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] added responsiveness and page not found animations
